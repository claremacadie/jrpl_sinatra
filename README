JRPL is a spectator sports prediction league.

JRPL was developed using the ruby web application library 'Sinatra'.
This uses the Rack server interface.
PostgreSQL is used to store the database behind the application.

To run this application locally on your machine:
  - Copy the files into their own project directory
  - Open up a Command Line Interface application (e.g. iTerm, VSCode, SublimeText)
  - Navigate to the jrpl project directory
  - Boot the server with: $ bundle exec ruby jrpl.ruby
  - Open a browser and navigate to: http://localhost:4567

Once you open the application:
  - The administrator has a username of 'Maccas', password 'a'
  - Non-administrator user is 'Clare Mac', password 'a'

To run the tests:
  - Open a separate CLI
  - Navigate to the jrpl project directory
  - Run: $ ruby test/jrpl_test.rb

To run rubocop (to check for coding style violations):
  - Run: $ rubocop filename.rb
